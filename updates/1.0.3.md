# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Fixed an issue with colors (tint0, tint1 & tint2), they were not functional.

2. Added Set Default option button on purchased cloth items. This new option will allow your players to set as default a specific item outfit than creating a whole outfit on wardrobes section.

3. Added Left & Right Rotations, Up & Down Camera Adjustments, Zoom In & Out Camera Adjustments and Hands Up / Down Animation.

4. Added new configuration options in case someone wants to teleport when a player enters the store to another location with instance / not (This will allow the players to modify clothing without others interacting - instance sets your players to a different bucket, similar to characters creation which does not let anyone interact or be visible).

5. Added Lighting option feature on the configuration option for the clothing stores.

6. Added an extra Coords configuration parameter on ActionMarkers for allowing you to not have the same Coords as interacting with displaying the circular 3d display.


*In the screenshot below, you will see the difference of lighting and location, including new button (Set Default) and Color Tints.
